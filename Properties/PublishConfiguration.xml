  <LongDescription>## Park and Road Maintenance Depot
  This Asset Pack adds a combined Park and Road Maintenance Depot asset to the game.

  It always bothered me that these depots are so big, especially the Road Maintenance depot. This asset adds a building on the lot of the Park Maintenance depot and offers combined functionality.
  It has 8 cars that can be either Plows, Park Maintenance vehicles, Road Maintenance vehicles or a combination of all.
